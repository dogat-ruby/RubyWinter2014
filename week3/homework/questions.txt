1. What is a symbol?
Symbol is an identifier that represents a unique name for an object.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Strings are mutable so the string needs to have its own place in memory in bytes. 
Symbols are immutable, takes one id in the memory and every same symbol shares the same object id. It takes less memory size because it doesn't instantiate a new copy every time.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block consists of chunks of code. You assign name to a block and call it as a block of code. It is enclosed with curly brackets. You can call it with yield.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature? 
It is curly bracket.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
If you want to find a pattern in the text, such as e-mail, date format, number or string patterns etc.
